# Movie Trailer Website

The Movie Trailer Website Project is the first project at the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).
It is a server-side python code to store a list of movies, including box art imagery, a movie trailer URL and further information about the movies, received via [myapifilms API](http://www.myapifilms.com).
This data will be served as a web page allowing visitors to watch the trailers of the movies.
Additional information from myapifilms.com are saved as json file in movies_data.json.
